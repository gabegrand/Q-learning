# Q-learning
Implements the gain-loss Q-learning model described in Frank et al. (2007). 
This model accounts for behavioral performance, as well as neurogenetic effects, in the probabilistic selection task. 
It also models the effects of dopaminergic medication on decision-making, as described in Frank (2004).
